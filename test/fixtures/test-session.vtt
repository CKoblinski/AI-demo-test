00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Alright, welcome back everyone. Let's do a quick recap.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): So last session, you all made it to the Astral Sea. You're on the remains of a dead god's skeleton, this massive floating corpse drifting through silver mist. The Correspond — these corrupted fungal creatures — have been spreading across the bones.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Hodim, you found a ring on the god's finger — a divine artifact that's been calling to you. Bixie scouted ahead and found the Correspond nest. And Hojberg... you punched a hole in reality last session, so that's fun.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Kristin (Bixie): Wait, I thought the nest was behind the ribcage?

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Yes, exactly. The nest is nestled in the god's ribcage. Pulsing purple fungal growths everywhere.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Okay so you're approaching the ribcage now. The bones are massive, each one the size of a building. The silver mist of the Astral Sea swirls around you.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): As you get closer, you can hear this wet, pulsing sound. Like a heartbeat, but wrong. The fungal growths on the bones are glowing faintly purple.

8
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Chris (Hodim): I hold up the ring. Does it react?

9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): The ring flares with golden light. And Hodim, you feel it — a surge of divine energy running up your arm. The dead god recognizes its own artifact.

10
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Chris (Hodim): Oh my god. That's incredible.

11
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Kristin (Bixie): Is it... waking up?

12
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Not waking up. But the ring is resonating with the remains. Like a tuning fork held to a bell.

13
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Suddenly, from the nest, three Correspond burst out. They're twisted humanoid shapes covered in purple fungal growths, moving in jerky, unnatural ways.

14
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Matt (Hojberg): Oh great. Here we go.

15
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Kristin (Bixie): How many?

16
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Three initially. But you can see more stirring in the nest.

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Kristin (Bixie): I draw my daggers. We need to move fast.

18
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Matt (Hojberg): I grip my glaive and step forward. Let's go.

19
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Chris (Hodim): Wait. The ring is still glowing. I think I can use this.

20
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Kristin (Bixie): Use it how? We don't have time for experiments!

21
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Chris (Hodim): I channel my smite through the ring. I'm going to try to blast them with divine energy.

22
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Roll for it.

23
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Chris (Hodim): Natural 20.

24
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Everyone: OH MY GOD!

25
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Matt (Hojberg): NO WAY!

26
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Kristin (Bixie): Are you serious right now?!

27
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Ashley (Calli): That's insane!

28
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): The ring ERUPTS with golden light. Hodim, your eyes blaze white-gold as divine energy channels through you and the ancient artifact simultaneously. A beam of radiant energy lances forward and hits the lead Correspond dead center. The creature SCREAMS — this horrible wet shriek — as the divine light burns through the fungal corruption.

29
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): The blast wave ripples outward, and the other two Correspond are thrown backwards into the ribcage. The fungal growths on the nearest bones start withering and crumbling.

30
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Chris (Hodim): The corruption... the ring is purging it?

31
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): It looks like it. The divine energy in the ring is antithetical to the Correspond's corruption. For a moment, the bones around you glow with a faint golden warmth — like the dead god remembers what it was.

32
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Ashley (Calli): That's beautiful and terrifying.

33
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Chris (Hodim): I look at the ring. Can I... can I heal a dead god?

34
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): That's... a very big question, Hodim.

35
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Kristin (Bixie): Okay while Hodim is having his existential crisis, can I loot the Correspond bodies?

36
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Matt (Hojberg): Classic Bixie.

37
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Ashley (Calli): We're witnessing a divine miracle and she wants loot.

38
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Kristin (Bixie): What? Dead things have stuff. That's just economics.

39
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Matt (Hojberg): "That's just economics" — Bixie, professional rogue.

40
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Everyone: haha

41
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Alright Bixie, you search the Correspond bodies. They're... not pleasant. The fungal growths are still warm. You find what looks like a crystallized spore — it's glowing faintly purple, about the size of a marble.

42
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Kristin (Bixie): I pick it up very carefully. What is this?

43
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): It's a Correspond Heartstone. The concentrated essence of whatever dark power animates these things. It pulses in your hand like a tiny heartbeat.

44
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Kristin (Bixie): Oh that's disgusting. I love it. I'm keeping it.

45
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Chris (Hodim): Should you really be touching that? What if it corrupts you?

46
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Kristin (Bixie): Hodim, I appreciate your concern, but I've touched worse.

47
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Matt (Hojberg): She has. She really has.

48
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Everyone: haha

49
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): As you're examining the heartstone, you hear something from deeper in the ribcage. A low rumbling. The ground — the bone — beneath your feet starts to vibrate.

50
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Ashley (Calli): That doesn't sound good.

51
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): From the nest, something massive starts to emerge. It's... it's a Correspond Queen. Easily twenty feet tall, covered in thick fungal armor, with tendrils of purple corruption spreading from it like roots.

52
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Kristin (Bixie): Okay so when I said we need to move fast earlier—

53
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Matt (Hojberg): Yeah we should have listened to you.

54
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Chris (Hodim): I step forward. The ring is still warm. I can do this.

55
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Kristin (Bixie): Hodim, that thing is TWENTY FEET TALL.

56
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Chris (Hodim): And I have a dead god's ring. I like my odds.

57
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Matt (Hojberg): That's the most paladin thing you've ever said.

58
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Everyone: haha

59
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): The Correspond Queen lets out a deafening roar. Purple spores fill the air around you.

60
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Connor Koblinski (DM): Roll initiative, everyone.
